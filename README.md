## Online store Capestone Project

This is my second and final project on Level 1 where the online store was supposed to made interractive using Javascript by creating a shopping cart page. Users can add items, view total price as they add to cart, see the VAT, shipping cost and when order is confirmed an order number is confirmed. A discount voucher can be used as well.
